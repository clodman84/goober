this should be a github issue but I can't be bothered right now.

the next time you have writer's block while coding, heres a sequence of things to do:

1. Implement node deletion
2. Implement graph saving
3. Implement graph loading
4. Implement "action logging" with item deactivated after edited handlers
5. Implement an undo TREE
6. Implement an undo tree inside, using the graph saving and loading backend
